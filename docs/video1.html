        <p class="mb-1">Circuit Switching is a technology used where the circuit is first established between two point and then a message could be sent between those two points.
            However the US government realized that if the Soviet union would ever attack them it could completely bring down the telecommunication infrastructure at that time because the connection between two points would not be established.
            Thus the government pushed ARPA to come up with a solution to this problem, thus accelerating computer research.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-1"> Bob Taylor an employee at ARPA was using terminals to access computers; and realized that it was annoying to use a different terminal per computer and theorized that a single terminal could suffice to talk to multiple computers at once.
            He wanted Heterogenous computers to communicate with one another across a network; he pitched the idea to his higher ups and received 1 million dollars in funding to do so.  </p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">Bob Taylor hired Lawrence Roberts an MIT graduate to help build the ARPA computer network.
            They came up with something called Packet Switching which is when a message is cut into bits and transmitted in a network and finds its way to the destination by itself and the receiving end reconstructs the message.
            The issue then being that each computer did not know how to talk to the other computers due to a language barrier.</p>

        <p class="mb-1">Interface Message Processors were developed, they were a type of translator for each computer so that they could ‘speak’ one unified language and communicate with one another,  and a company called BBN won the contract to produce them.
            UCLA wrote code to allow the I.M.P to communicate with one another.
            By the end of 1969 the I.M.P arrived at UCLA and 4 computers were on the network. </p>

            <p class="mb-1">Two years since the first network was established ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers connected to the network.
                A ‘killer’ application was also launched in 1971, Email.
                Ray Tomlinson of ARPA made the application and allowed people to communicate much quicker within the network, came the use of the ‘@’ symbol</p>

            <p class="mb-1">ARPA had fewer than 25 sites online in the ARPANET and demonstrated it in Washington DC and it was huge hit.
                More and more places started using this technology to created their own networks for their offices or campuses and there came Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks, the former (LAN) being devices connected to each other in a network and the latter (WAN) being those networks connected together in a larger network. </p>
