                With the growing technology by late 1990s, people are turning their sight from radio,
                tv to the internet. The new fashion of electronic shopping is coming. At the same time,
                two of the biggest e-commerce companies, Amazon and Ebay, are starting their business, and
                they are going to create a whole new model of commerce.

                One of the key points in security transport is public-key cryptography, which is created by Whitfield
                Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a
                cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and
                private keys, which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic
                algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only
                requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without
                compromising security.

                Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, was thinking at the very first about what Amazon is going to do,
                the trend of tide, and the books. Bezos makes a plan and leads the company - ‘get, big, fast’. As a
                contrast, Pierre Omidyar is a pure technology-oriented programmer, he doesn’t consider too much about
                the business of the company, but tries to build the code, the platform and the ideal. No matter what,
                they all meet the blooming of the computer industry.

                A critical rule that ensures the blooming of computer technology and the internet is Moore Rule.
                Moore's Law refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every
                two years, though the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed
                and capability of our computers to increase every couple of years, and we will pay less for them.
                Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential, which means it would grow
                faster and faster.

                More and more companies are established, the dot com bubble is becoming bigger and bigger. The dot
                com bubble was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in
                internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s. During the dotcom bubble, the
                value of equity markets grew exponentially, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq index rising from
                under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between the years 1995 and 2000. In 2001 and through 2002 the bubble
                burst, with equities entering a bear market.

                The crash that followed saw the Nasdaq index, which had risen five-fold between 1995 and 2000, tumble
                from a peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct 4, 2002, a 76.81% fall. By the end of
                2001, most dotcom stocks had gone bust. Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like
                Cisco, Intel and Oracle lost more than 80% of their value. It would take 15 years for the Nasdaq to
                regain its dotcom peak, which it did on April 23, 2015.

                The bubble ultimately burst in a spectacular fashion, leaving many investors facing steep losses and
                several internet companies going bust. Companies that famously survived the bubble include Amazon,
                eBay. Finally, people get to realize the true aim of the internet: create values, and
                lead the further development of the internet.
