                Once the internet was created and many sites were available
                to access; there was not  a very intuitive way to access
                that information, especially in a point and click format
                similar to how we do it today in 2020.
                Thus came the inception of a software company called
                NetScape (originally Mosaic). They were the company who developed the first web
                browser anyone could use it and was much simpler than previous ways of access in the internet.

                In 1993 Marc Andreessen a graduate student
                at University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana along with
                6 peers made a graphical user interface to easily browse websites.
                This attracted the attention of Jim Clarke, due to the graphical user interface becoming insanely popular over the course of the next 2 years.

                In April 1994 Jim Clarke, an investor and founder of
                Silicon Graphics, contacted Marc Andreesen and they
                formed a company which would be known as Netscape Communications.

                Bill Gates the co-founder of Microsoft,
                did not believe that the world wide web would be a
                technology that would stick around. He thought that the
                WWW should be heavily monitored and only accessible with
                pay walls and not for everyone for free. Microsoft Network
                was made which sort of web portal for people to access the WWW. He wanted to have monopoly of consumer PCs.

                Netscape Communications main goal was to
                “take over the world” with their new software
                which allowed the WWW in the hands of any regular person
                in an easy manner. They started working on the next
                version of Mosaic called Netscape Navigator in October 1994.
                They were a budding startup and grew exponentially fast.
                The internet age had begun, they amassed a million downloads
                very quickly.

                Microsoft grew wary of Netscape because
                it felt as if its iron grip on the computing industry
                had been loosened. Where computers could not need the
                Windows Operating System and use only a browser to do
                all the work on a computer.

                employees which detailed that Microsoft would need to
                step up and focus on the Web. Saying it was the
                “Single most important development in computing since the PC”.
                They needed to take down their competitor Netscape, as soon
                as possible.

                Gary Reback an antitrust lawyer,
                who always had his eye set on the transgressions of
                Microsoft which used its power to an extent to squash
                any competitors without any remorse, in turn breaking
                antitrust laws. Microsoft even offered to buy Netscape
                for 1 Million Dollars.

                A critical rule that ensures the blooming of computer technology and the internet is Moore Rule.
                Moore's Law refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every
                two years, though the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed
                and capability of our computers to increase every couple of years, and we will pay less for them.
                Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential, which means it would grow
                faster and faster.

                More and more companies are established, the dot com bubble is becoming bigger and bigger. The dot
                com bubble was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in
                internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s. During the dotcom bubble, the
                value of equity markets grew exponentially, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq index rising from
                under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between the years 1995 and 2000. In 2001 and through 2002 the bubble
                burst, with equities entering a bear market.

                The crash that followed saw the Nasdaq index, which had risen five-fold between 1995 and 2000, tumble
                from a peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct 4, 2002, a 76.81% fall. By the end of
                2001, most dotcom stocks had gone bust. Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like
                Cisco, Intel and Oracle lost more than 80% of their value. It would take 15 years for the Nasdaq to
                regain its dotcom peak, which it did on April 23, 2015.

                The bubble ultimately burst in a spectacular fashion, leaving many investors facing steep losses and
                several internet companies going bust. Companies that famously survived the bubble include Amazon,
                eBay. Finally, people get to realize the true aim of the internet: create values, and
                lead the further development of the internet.
