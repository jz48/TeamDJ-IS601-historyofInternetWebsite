                For years and years, people are communicating for seeking values, receiving information and
                sharing ideas. But now,  the way people communicate has been deeply changed. The new social
                contact companies have raised, like Youtube, Myspace and Facebook. We usually think how the
                web changes the world, but now, the world also changes the web by the power of people.

                Think about how technology and people change the way playing the music: For years before, when there
                was no internet or mp3, what would you do if you wanted to listen to music? You need to think about
                the name of the CD, go outside to the store, find the CD out from the shelf, buy it and take it back.
                Then you can use the machine to play the CD. What an amazing thing! So, it’s not hard to think about
                what would happen when mp3 comes out. People use this portable machine to listen to music and don’t
                have to stay at home by a big player. And furthermore, as a new technology, MP3 leads to more changes.

                MP3 is a coding format for digital audio. Originally defined as the third audio format of the MPEG-1
                standard, it was retained and further extended—defining additional bit-rates and support for more
                audio channels—as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard. A third version, known
                as MPEG 2.5—extended to better support lower bit rates—is commonly implemented, but is not a
                recognized standard. MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an elementary
                stream of MPEG-1 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio encoded data, without other complexities of the MP3 standard.

                Another technology also plays an important rule in this change: Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or
                networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between
                peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to
                form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing
                power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without
                the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers
                of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply
                of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing
                similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique
                resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks
                beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to all the peers.

                With the development of the technology and people themselves, the spreading of the information and
                the transporting of the data becomes much easier and faster. However, it also brings troubles. The
                copyright and law issues raised at this time. And with the conflicts and resolving, new giants
                raised, the web2.0 is coming.
